# ICS4U-3-ModellingAndSimulation
Following in this repository are a series of exercises and examples to start our learning for object oriented programming and specifically the use of objects to model and simulate the world around us.

## Learning Goals
*I can use my understanding of object-oriented programming to develop a model and a simulation.*

I can:
- [ ] Write code that meets specific requirements
- [ ] Clearly describe the function and purpose of code
- [ ] Work effectively with others
- [ ] Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simple steps I can achieve with code
- [ ] Use coding patterns to organize my thoughts and better understand the world
